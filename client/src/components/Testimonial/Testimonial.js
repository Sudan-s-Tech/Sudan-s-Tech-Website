                                    I'm very glad to participate in the htm qubits in association with sundantech. They are doing great. It is helpful and great to learn from well-experienced mentors. I'm very much interested in open cv and cloud, the qubits helped me to gain some knowledge and hands-on experience. I want to thanks hack the mountains and looking forward to more sessions.
